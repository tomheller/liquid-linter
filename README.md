# Liquid Linter

A node package that lets you lint liquid template strings.

## Installation

```
npm install --save liquid-linter
```

## Usage

```javascript
var linter = require('liquid-linter');
var testString = "{% capture %} Lorem ipsum dolor {% endcapture %}";

linter.lintString(testString, function(err) {
  if(err) {
    console.log(err);
  };
});
```

## CLI usage

If you are looking to use the liquid linter as a cli tool, @Potherca created a wrapper around this package, which you can find here: https://github.com/DealerDirect/liquid-linter-cli

## Methods

* `lintFile(filepath, callback)`
* `lintString(testString, callback)`
* `lintFilePromise(filepath)`
* `lintStringPromise(testString)`
* `loadTags({blocks: [], tags:[]})`

### lintFile(filepath, callback)

**filepath**: Path to a file that needs linting
**callback**: function that gets an error array

### lintString(string, callback)

**string**: String that needs linting
**callback**: function that gets an error array

### lintFilePromise(filepath)

**filepath**: Path to a file that needs linting
Returns a thenable promise with the error array

### lintStringPromise(string)

**string**: String that needs linting
Returns a thenable promise with the error array


### loadTags(obj)

Liquid is a very extendable language, and you might want to have your custom tags validate in the linter as well. The `loadTags` function will let you register dummy block and simple tags, so the linter will pass.

**obj**: The passed object contains of two properties `blocks` and `tags`

Example:

```javascript
var linter = require('liquid-linter');
var testString = "{% section %} Lorem ipsum dolor  {% button text='Buttontext' %} {% endsection %}";

linter.loadTags({
  blocks: ["section"],
  tags: ["button", "color"]
});

linter.lintString(testString, function(err) {
  if(err) {
    console.log(err);
  };
});
```


## Error object

The error object contains the following properties:
```javascript
{
  name: String        // the name of the Liquid error raised
  message: String     // Errormessage of what went wrong
  location: {
    line: Number     // Line in which the error occured
    col: Number      // Column in which the error occured
    length: Number   // Length of the errorous string
  }
}
```
